## Core Concepts

**Stages** organize secrets by environment:
- `local` - Local development environment
- `staging` - Pre-production testing
- `production` - Live environment

**Vaults** provide the storage backend:
- **AWS SSM** - Parameter Store for simple key-value storage
- **AWS Secrets Manager** - Advanced features with rotation support

**Context syntax** for cross-vault operations:
```bash
# Default vault
keep list --stage=production

# Explicit vault
keep list --stage=production --vault=ssm

# Vault:stage syntax
keep copy DB_PASSWORD --from=secretsmanager:local --to=ssm:production
```

## Common Workflows

**Local â†’ Production:**
1. Set secrets in local environment
2. Test with exported `.env` files
3. Copy to staging for testing
4. Promote to production

**Team Collaboration:**
- Share vault configurations via `.keep/` directory
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Control production access with IAM policies
