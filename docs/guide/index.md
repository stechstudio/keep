# Introduction

Keep is a PHP toolkit for managing secrets across applications, environments, and teams. It provides a consistent CLI interface for AWS SSM Parameter Store and AWS Secrets Manager.

## Why Keep?

Managing secrets across development, staging, and production is challenging. Keep solves this by providing:

- **Unified Interface**: One CLI for all your secret vaults
- **Stage Organization**: Separate secrets by environment (development, staging, production)
- **Template Generation**: Build configuration files from templates with automatic secret injection
- **Team Collaboration**: Share vault access without exposing secret values
- **Laravel Integration**: Native support with helper functions and service provider
