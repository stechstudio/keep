# Managing Secrets

## Guides

### [Creating & Viewing Secrets](./creating-viewing)
Set, get, list, and delete secrets across environments.

### [Cross-Environment Operations](./cross-environment) 
Copy secrets between stages, import from `.env` files, and compare environments.

### [Exporting to .env](./exporting-to-env)
Generate plaintext `.env` files for traditional deployments.

### [Runtime Secrets](./runtime-secrets)
Secure, high-performance alternative using encrypted caches.

## Core Concepts

**Stages** organize secrets by environment:
- `development` - Local development
- `staging` - Pre-production testing
- `production` - Live environment

**Vaults** provide the storage backend:
- **AWS SSM** - Parameter Store for simple key-value storage
- **AWS Secrets Manager** - Advanced features with rotation support

**Context syntax** for cross-vault operations:
```bash
# Default vault
keep list --stage=production

# Explicit vault
keep list --stage=production --vault=ssm

# Vault:stage syntax
keep copy DB_PASSWORD --from=secretsmanager:development --to=ssm:production
```

## Common Workflows

**Development â†’ Production:**
1. Set secrets in development
2. Test with exported `.env` files
3. Copy to staging for testing
4. Promote to production

**Team Collaboration:**
- Share vault configurations via `.keep/` directory
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Control production access with IAM policies
